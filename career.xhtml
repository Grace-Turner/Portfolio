            <p>
                I am interested in working in the digital design and information technology industries, more
                specifically in 3D modelling and in programming, application development and web development. In the
                long term, I hope to be able to combine my skills in digital design and information technology, likely
                through games or application development. For this reason, I decided to create the components of a 3D
                game for my major project, focusing on improving my 3D modelling abilities while also practicing
                character and user interface design.
            </p>

            <p>
                My short term goals for my career will include getting a graduate role in information technology, likely
                in programming or data analytics, to learn how to practically apply the skills I have learnt at
                university. I intend to start in information technology due to the high availability and range of jobs
                available (Northbridge Recruitment 2023, paras 3-4 ), giving me freedom to find what I enjoy doing while
                getting work experience to improve my skills. In my free time I can continue honing my 3D modelling
                skills and strengthening my portfolio.
            </p>

            <p>
                My long term goal for my career is to combine my interest in digital design and information technology,
                through application and web development and eventually through games development. I am interested in 3D
                modelling as I personally enjoy working in 3D and appreciate the aesthetics of 3D games and films. As 3D
                modelling is a growing field (Modelo 2024, paras 1-2), I hope to be able to find work in this area, in
                particular in modelling environments.
            </p>

            <p>
                For my major project, I am developing the components of a 3D deductive horror computer game. By the end
                of the trimester, I intend to have created the character designs, modelled and textured the environment
                and designed the user interface for the game. Designing the characters will allow me to practice my 2D
                design skills and work on drawing human characters, which is something I personally struggle with.
                Modelling and texturing the environment, which will make up the majority of the project, will allow me
                to focus on my 3D modelling and texturing skills. The game environment I have planned will allow me to
                practice modelling enclosed and open spaces in the modelling of the mansion and surrounding estate,
                creating an architectural model for the building itself and a variety of different object models for
                inside the building. These models will be created in Autodesk Maya, an industry standard in 3D modelling
                and animation (Guru Staff 2023, paras 5-6). I will then texture the environment in Adobe Substance
                Painter, another industry standard software (Mobsby 2019, para. 2), which will allow me to refine my
                texturing skills as well as my understanding of colour theory for game design. Finally, I will design
                the user interface for the game, an important aspect of games development as well as application
                development generally that I will likely need to use regularly in my career.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, my major project will be a worthwhile addition to my portfolio due to its relevance to various
                skills I hope to use in my career pathway. This will allow me to refine and demonstrate my skills to
                potential future employers.
            </p>
