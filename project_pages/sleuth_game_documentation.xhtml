            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p class="Details">
                For my design project I chose to plan, create designs and make assets for a high-poly 3D cooperative
                multiplayer computer game called <i>Sleuth</i>. For my deliverables I ended up creating character
                designs, the modelled, textured and rendered exterior environment, and designs for the user interface.

            <h4>Synopsis</h4>
            <p class="Details">
                <i>Sleuth</i> takes place in the 1920s, in the French Chateau of a wealthy family. A murder has taken
                place in the mansion, and the players (up to five) have to figure out who the culprit is. However, the
                culprit still lurks around the building, and will attack the investigative team in order to stop them
                solving the case.
            </p>

            <p class="Details">
                Each of the playable characters has their own unique special ability that can be used to help them solve
                the case or fight off the attacker.
            </p>

            <p class="Details">
                The game is a deductive horror/murder mystery that requires the players to cooperate to solve the case.
            </p>

            <p class="Details">
                For the pre-production, we came up with our initial idea, created sketches, and then iterative
                prototypes until we decided on a final design.
            </p>

            <p class="Details">
                My initial sketches of mansions led my lecturer to suggest a make the setting a French Chateau, as that
                was the style I had sketched a lot of.

            <h4>Break Down</h4>
            <p class="Details"><b>Planning the Environment:</b></p>
            <p class="Details">
                For the second part of the project, I began creating a floorplan of the building to use as a blueprint
                for blocking in Autodesk Maya. I used a rectangle as a size reference for a person to try and make the
                rooms reasonably sized compared to one another. I looked into different French Chateaus and rooms they
                often had and planned the layout from there. I planned the building with three floors, the additional
                floor being in the attic. Finally, I imported the finalised floor plan into an Autodesk Maya scene to
                begin the modelling.
            </p>

            <section class="row">

            </section>

            <p class="Details"><b>Blocking the Environment:</b></p>
            <p class="Details">
                I used the imported floor plans to scale polygon primitives to appropriate sizes and
                shapes. I made sure to be careful with my edge loops to avoid ngons from the start of the modelling
                process to prevent issues down the line. At this stage I blocked out the main building, interior walls,
                roof and front stairs.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                While blocking the interior walls I realised the drastically varying height of the mansion roof would
                cause issues with the character fitting through doors and under roofs in the attic, so I decided to
                leave out the third floor.

            </figure>

            <p class="Details"><b>Low Poly Modelling:</b></p>
            <p>
                After blocking the environment, I added more detail to make low poly models. This included adding
                windows and doors as well as their frames to the model and adding a courtyard area with a water feature
                and benches. If elements were repeated I only modelled them once and duplicated them later after
                smoothing. I realised for rendering it would look better if I had a textured landscape around the
                building as well, so I created a simple low poly mesh and added height variation for realism to create a
                landscape for the building. I realised at this stage I was not going to have time to model any of the
                interior as I had originally hoped to do so I focused on creating a high quality exterior.
            </p>

            <p class="Details"><b>UV Unwrapping and Smooth Preparation:</b></p>
            <p class="Details">
                After creating the low poly models, I added basic phong E Maya materials and used the UV editor to UV
                unwrap all of them, prioritising minimising warping as it is an architectural object and it can cause
                issues with brick patterns. I tried to hide seams where possible, and where not possible placed them in
                areas that would be seen by players less often. After UV unwrapping each model I used smooth preview to
                determine where supporting edge loops were needed and added them as required, checking to ensure this
                did not create any ngons.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p class="Details"><b>Smoothing:</b></p>
            <p class="Details">
                Next I applied the smoothing, set to 1 or 2 depending on the size and complexity of the model. I left
                the main building frame and windows without smoothing as they did not have any visible curved surfaces
                and this would prevent unnecessary detail causing the application to run slower. After smoothing I
                duplicated the components that were repeated in the scene, positioned them as needed, and then combined
                most of the components, leaving the landscape separate. I also left each of the doors as separate meshes
                to ensure they could be functional in the game. I laid out the UVs for the combined objects, however,
                due to the large polygon count and size of the main building, I was limited to 2048 for the resolution
                and 4 UDIMs, which restricted the amount of detail visible in the applied textures. If I were to
                continue with this project I would likely need to invest in a computer with more processing power.

            <p class="Details"><b>Exporting and Texturing:</b></p>
            <p class="Details">
                I exported my meshes as fbx files and brought them into Adobe Substance Painter for texturing. I used
                4096 resolution for the textures in Substance Painter but still found the amount of texture detail I
                could achieve to be very limited due to the small number of UDIMs for such a large mesh. I discovered at
                this point I had ended up with some strange geometry on the front of the building mesh, so I fixed this
                in Maya and reimported it to Substance Painter.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                I did research into which textures would be most appropriate for a 1920s French Chateau, finding that
                slate roof tiles and parquet floors were popular (Chateau De Pleuville n.d., para. 3; DaVinci Roofscapes
                2022, para. 1; Livingstone 2019, para. 7), outer walls were often limestone and inner walls filled with
                limestone rubble, mud, lime mortar or plaster (Chateau De Pleuville n.d., para. 1). Other materials used
                often included reinforced concrete, glass and steel (Bertolazzi 2013, p. 1). For the textures, I used
                some of the default textures and some additional textures downloaded from Adobe's Substance 3D Assets
                page to find those that matched closely to the materials I had researched. For the roof I made a custom
                stencil to achieve the roof tile look that I wanted. I initially created a stencil for long rectangular
                tiles, then created one for tiles with beveled corners, which I ended up using because I thought the
                more rounded look suited the French Chateau style better. I also created a custom stencil for the
                doorknobs in a 1920s French Chateau style, however, due to the limited resolution this was not very
                clearly visible in the final rendered result.

            <p class="Details"><b>Rendering: </b></p>
            <p class="Details">
                Next I moved on to the rendering stage, which was by far the most problematic of all the stages of my
                project. I had initially planned to texture using Autodesk Arnold in Maya, as I had done my modelling in
                Maya and found that usually my computer ran better with Maya than Unreal Engine. However, I encountered
                a number of issues in the Arnold settings that were not compatible with my computer such as issues with
                the type of Denoiser and necessary hardware. After I finally got it to work, it was taking far too long
                to render the images that I needed, so I decided to try Unreal Engine again since I had used it in the
                past.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">Using Unreal Engine I was easily able to set up the materials. From here, I used level
                sequences to render images and videos from the textured model, using a tutorial video
                (DrawWithNightBuzzer 2023) for instructions. However, I encountered another hardware problem, as I was
                not able to use path tracing on my computer. I researched how I would need to change the
                settings they used in the video to work for my computer. I was then able to render images and videos
                relatively quickly at 1920 x 1080p.

            <p class="Details"><b>Improving Character Design Presentation:</b></p>
            <p class="Details">
                While waiting for the various applications and software to load, I improved the presentation of the
                character designs on my website by adding a simple picture frame around the designs and adding a more
                detailed description about them.

            <p class="Details"><b>User Interface Designs:</b></p>
            <p class="Details">
                Finally, I used some of the rendered images of the environment to make designs for the user interface,
                specifically the title screen, in-game maps and role-based screen layout for different characters. I had
                some trouble deciding on fonts for the title screen and ended up using one of the fonts from a different
                prototype as I thought it suited the game better. I used my previous floor plans to make a map screen
                that would overlay the main game to help players navigate the building. I used dark, desaturated colours
                and a dark red to enhance the horror themes.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                I created designs for the main user interface of the game, with different variations for each character.
                Each character's special ability would appear differently on the screen, and would also work differently
                once activated, so I created different versions of the interface design for each character.

            <h4>Contributions</h4>
            <p class="Details">
                I completed my project individually. This included planning the game, designing the characters,
                modelling, texturing and rendering the exterior environment and designing the user interface. I received
                feedback from my lecturer in the weekly classes over the two trimester duration of the task and got some
                feedback from my classmates.
            </p>

            <h4>Responding to Feedback</h4>
            <p class="Details">
                I received a significant amount of feedback over the course of the project, mostly from my lecturer. I
                implemented a significant amount of the feedback but declined some because I didn't think it was
                suitable.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                My lecturer suggested adding an introduction clip for the mystery at the start of the game, such as a
                news report. I thought this was a good idea but unfortunately didn't have enough time to implement it,
                however, I do think it would be included in the final version for release.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                I was initially undecided on whether the attacker was a member of the five characters or an external
                non-player character. In my feedback from my lecturer it was suggested I needed to decide this as it
                would have a significant impact on gameplay. I ended up deciding the attacker would be a non-player
                character, as I had originally intended to create a cooperative multiplayer game to encourage people to
                collaborate and work together to solve the mystery, and I think having a player be the attacker would
                hinder this goal.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                It was suggested by my lecturer and classmate Harry that I make the game a combination of online and in
                person gameplay. I ended up deciding not to implement this feedback as I think it is more important for
                the game to be accessible to players at all different locations, while in person gameplay would require
                players to be able to meet up in real life.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                I was told by my lecturer to expand on the characters, and later to give them names to give them more
                personality. I did want to keep the characters without too much backstory to allow the players to
                project their own personality onto the characters, however, I do think there is a benefit to making the
                characters more distinct, so I did end up naming them. I researched popular French first and surnames
                from the 1920s (Behind the Name 2022; Forebears n.d.) and used those to name the characters
                appropriately for the setting.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                I was also given feedback about the expandability of the game concept; that is, the potential for
                sequels or a movie adaptation. I do think that is very much possible with such a broad concept. It was
                suggested that some of the prototypes of the characters in different time periods could be implemented
                as additional games in the franchise, which I think is a good idea.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                It was suggested that I actually include the floor plans I had made in game as a map for players. I
                thought this was an excellent suggestion and used them to make a design for a map screen.
            </p>

            <p class="Details">
                It was also suggested I try to ensure the environment was fitting for the 1920s setting. While there
                weren't a lot of objects as I only modelled the exterior, I did research the materials used during that
                time period for accurate texturing.

                When I was struggling to decide on fonts, I asked a friend for their opinion and ended up using the font
                they chose, <i>Another Danger</i> (The Branded Quotes 2016), from the two I presented.

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p class="Details">
                Overall I am happy with the results of my design project. I think my main struggles during this project
                were time management and rendering the models. I had trouble completing the amount of work I hoped to
                due to struggles with managing my workload, as I would have liked to have modelled an interior room as
                well, however, I am happy with the quality of the deliverables I did accomplish.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                I think initially I was overambitious in what I hoped to achieve as I thought I would be able to
                complete the interior and exterior. However, I was happy with the outcome of the exterior, and with the
                type of project I created I had room for flexibility in how much would be completed in the two
                trimesters.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                I had a lot of trouble because of the limitations of my computer, so if I were to fully implement this
                project I would need stronger hardware. I found that the slow loading times and poor texture rendering
                in real time made it very difficult to assess if the texture looked right or not. I also had significant
                difficulty with rendering, in part due to the hardware limitations. I think in hindsight I should have
                rendered in Unreal Engine from the start because I am familiar with it and that is likely where the game
                would be implemented anyway.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                I found getting consistent feedback throughout the trimesters helpful and it led to the development of
                several ideas I hadn't considered originally.
            </p>
            <p class="Details">
                I think this project successfully demonstrates my capabilities in 3D modelling, texturing and rendering,
                as well as game design in general. I have demonstrated the use of several different industry-standard
                software products, including Autodesk Maya, Unreal Engine, Adobe Substance Painter and Adobe
                Illustrator, which shows my technical proficiency, while the concept development demonstrates my
                creativity and ability to come up with several different ideas for one project.
